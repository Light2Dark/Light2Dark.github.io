			<p2><br> Malaysia is my home, my birthplace, the land upon which God created me to be. However, there are problems. Problems that create injustice,
			sow discontent, belittle our children and cause suffering. These problems can and must be improved upon. My focus lies on education, something that I am deeply
			passionate on and have muddled on murky waters to find the light in the chaotic world of schooling. This blog, this forum is a place to discuss on improvements
			and implementations to improve our education system. Make a change! Believe in it! </p2>
